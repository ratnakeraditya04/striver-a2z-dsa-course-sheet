Arrow Function should not be used in following conditions -> 
1. cannot be used as constructors to create new objects
2. Arrow functions cannot be used as generator functions that use the yield keyword to return multiple values over time.


The yield keyword is used in special functions called generator functions, which can return multiple values over time instead of returning just one value like a normal function.

Ex - 

const gen = function* (genarator)/name (...args)
{
    yield Statement 1 ; 
    yield statement 2 ; 
    .... so on. 
}

Calling the Genarator Function - Genarator function is actually used to return multiple values from the same function. 

gen.next().value ; 
To again get the value from the next gen function we use - 
gen.next().value ;
