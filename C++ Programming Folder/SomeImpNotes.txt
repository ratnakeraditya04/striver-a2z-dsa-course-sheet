C++ A Programming Language that is both Procedural and Object Oriented Language. 

User Input / Output - 
cout , 
cin , 
cerr , 
clog 

Un-buffered standard error stream (cerr): The C++ cerr is the standard error stream that is used to output the errors. 
Buffered standard error stream (clog): This is also an instance of ostream class and used to display errors but unlike cerr the error is first inserted into a buffer and is stored in the buffer until it is not fully filled.


POINTERS IN C++. 

Dangling pointer: A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been deleted (or freed) is called a dangling pointer.
File Pointer: The pointer to a FILE data type is called a stream pointer or a file pointer.
Null Pointers are those pointers that do not point to any memory location.
Size of Pointers using sizeof attribute. 

STL - Standard Template Library - 
Four Imp Components - 
1. Algorithms 
2. Containers 
3. Functors 
4. Iterators

Asymptotic Analysis - 
Order of Growth of time taken by a function in terms of input size.
Space Complexity - 
Order of Growth of Function over memory occupied by a function over a period of time. 
Auxiliary Space - 
Order of growth of function over extra space or temporary space over a period of time.
